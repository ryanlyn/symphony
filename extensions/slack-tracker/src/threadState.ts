/**
 * Thread-command state model. Slack reactions are per-author (the bot cannot remove a human's
 * reaction and vice versa), so reactions cannot carry a jointly-edited status. The thread is the
 * shared, ts-ordered medium both sides can write to, so STATUS LIVES IN THE THREAD:
 *
 * - Humans transition status by mentioning the bot with a `!`-prefixed command reply:
 *   `@bot !done`, `@bot !cancel`, `@bot !reopen`, `@bot !status <Name>`. The bang keeps
 *   transitions unmistakable next to ordinary prompts addressed to the bot.
 * - The bot (agent/runtime) transitions status by posting a `status: <Name>` reply.
 * - A bot-mention reply with NO command re-opens a terminal issue to the default
 *   non-terminal state: mentioning the bot again always means "this needs attention".
 * - The latest event by ts wins. Reactions remain a bot-owned visibility mirror and the
 *   back-compat source for threads that have never seen a command or bot status reply.
