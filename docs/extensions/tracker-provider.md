# Tracker provider

This page is the build recipe for a new tracker backend. It is for an extension author wiring Lorenz
to an issue source the engine does not yet speak to. A tracker backend is one package that implements
the `TrackerProvider` contract from `@lorenz/tracker-sdk` and one line that registers it. The core
(config parsing, the dispatch loop, the MCP server, the CLI) is provider-agnostic and reaches every
backend through a registry, so a new tracker needs no core changes.

The [linear](../trackers/linear.md) and [jira](../trackers/jira.md) trackers are the worked examples;
`extensions/linear-tracker/` is the most complete reference. `test/tracker-extension.test.ts` is the
executable form of this recipe: it builds a fake `notion` provider from SDK surface alone and drives
config parsing, dispatch validation, client creation, and the MCP tools through it. If a new backend
needs more than the steps below to keep that test green, the provider boundary has regressed.

## The `TrackerProvider` hook table

`TrackerProvider` lives in `packages/tracker-sdk/src/provider.ts`. Only `kind` and `createClient` are
mandatory; every other hook is optional and the core degrades cleanly when it is absent.

| Hook | Called by | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kind` | `TrackerRegistry` | the provider selector matched against `tracker.kind` (e.g. `"linear"`, `"jira"`); the registry key |
| `configAliases` | config parse | snake_case to camelCase alias map for this provider's option keys (e.g. `{ project_slug: "projectSlug" }`); applied before `parseOptions` |
| `envFallbacks` | config parse | env vars consulted for shared `tracker:` fields left unset, keyed by field name (e.g. `{ apiKey: "LINEAR_API_KEY" }`) |
| `defaultEndpoint` | config parse | endpoint used when `tracker.endpoint` is unset (e.g. `https://api.linear.app/graphql`) |
| `parseOptions(options, context)` | config parse | validate and normalize the provider's keys (aliases already applied); the returned record becomes `settings.tracker.options`; throw `tracker.<key> ...` on bad input |
| `validateDispatch(settings)` | CLI startup (`validateDispatchConfig`) | throw when parsed settings cannot drive dispatch (missing credentials or required options) |
| `createClient(settings, context)` | runtime | build the `RuntimeTrackerClient` that feeds candidate issues into the dispatch loop |
| `createToolOps(settings, context)` | neutral `tracker` pack | return the `TrackerToolOps` backing the seven `tracker_*` tools, or `undefined` for a backend with no agent-facing operations |
| `defaultToolPacks(settings)` | MCP mount | provider-specific tool packs mounted by default when this tracker drives dispatch; the neutral `tracker` pack is always mounted separately |
| `projectUrl(settings)` | TUI / dashboard | operator-facing URL of the tracked project |

Two context objects are passed in. `TrackerContext` (`parseOptions`, `createClient`) carries
`env: NodeJS.ProcessEnv` and, at parse time only, `resolveSecret(value, fallbackEnvVar?)` for `$VAR`
and `op://` references. `TrackerOpsContext` (`createToolOps`) carries only `fetchImpl: typeof fetch`.

The hooks fire in distinct phases. At config-parse time, `configAliases` and `envFallbacks` rewrite
the raw bundle, then `parseOptions` validates it into `settings.tracker.options`. At startup,
`validateDispatch` runs once to reject undispatchable settings before the loop starts. At runtime,
`createClient` produces the polling client. When the MCP server mounts tools, `createToolOps` and
`defaultToolPacks` decide the agent-facing surface. `projectUrl` is read by the dashboards.

## The `RuntimeTrackerClient` contract

`createClient` returns a `RuntimeTrackerClient`, defined in `packages/domain/src/index.ts`. This is
the minimum the dispatch loop needs from any backend, small enough that the in-process memory tracker
can stand in for a real one.

```ts
interface RuntimeTrackerClient {
  fetchCandidateIssues(): Promise<Issue[]>;
  fetchIssuesByIds(ids: string[]): Promise<Issue[]>;
  fetchIssuesByStates?(states: string[]): Promise<Issue[]>;
}
```

- `fetchCandidateIssues()` returns issues currently eligible for dispatch: those whose state is in
  `tracker.active_states`, filtered by the configured assignee where the backend supports it. The
  runtime applies routing labels, blockers, and concurrency caps afterward; the client does not.
- `fetchIssuesByIds(ids)` re-fetches specific issues by tracker id and preserves the requested order.
  The runtime calls this to refresh an issue it already knows.
- `fetchIssuesByStates(states)` is optional. It backs best-effort flows, notably terminal-state
  workspace cleanup at startup. A backend that cannot answer state queries cheaply omits it, and the
  caller skips those flows.

Each client returns the domain `Issue` shape, not the backend's raw payload. `Issue` requires
`stateType: IssueStateType` (one of `backlog`, `unstarted`, `started`, `completed`, `canceled`,
`triage`); normalizing the backend's status into that field is the provider's job. The Linear client maps Linear states, the
Jira client maps Jira `statusCategory.key`. Keep the raw payload on the issue for the agent to read.

## The options-bag pattern

Provider-specific config never appears as a named field on `TrackerSettings`. `TrackerSettings`
exposes only the fields every backend shares (`kind`, `endpoint`, `apiKey`, `activeStates`,
`terminalStates`, dispatch routing). Everything else lives opaquely in `settings.tracker.options`,
validated once by `parseOptions` and read back through a typed accessor the provider owns. Core code
must not read `options` keys directly.

`parseOptions` runs at config-parse time after aliases and env fallbacks are applied. The tracker SDK
ships the helpers it needs, all in `packages/tracker-sdk/src/options.ts`:

- `rejectUnknownOptions(options, known, kind)` throws on a typo'd key.
- `stringOption(options, key)` reads one string.
- `stringListOption(options, key)` reads a list; an empty list collapses to `undefined`.
- `resolveEnvReference("$VAR", env)` resolves an env reference.

`stringOption` and `stringListOption` shape their error as `tracker.<key> must be ...`, so an operator
sees the exact failing key. `rejectUnknownOptions` reports the typo'd keys together as `unsupported
tracker option(s) for kind "<kind>": <keys>`. The Linear provider's `parseOptions` and its accessor
pair up like this:

```ts
parseOptions(options, _context) {
  rejectUnknownOptions(options, ["projectSlug", "projectSlugs", "projectLabels"], "linear");
  return {
    projectSlug: stringOption(options, "projectSlug"),
    projectSlugs: stringListOption(options, "projectSlugs"),
    projectLabels: stringListOption(options, "projectLabels"),
  };
}

// extensions/linear-tracker/src/options.ts
export function linearTrackerOptions(settings: Settings): LinearTrackerOptions {
  const options = settings.tracker.options;
  return {
    projectSlug: stringOption(options, "projectSlug") || undefined,
    projectSlugs: stringListOption(options, "projectSlugs"),
    projectLabels: stringListOption(options, "projectLabels"),
  };
}
```

Every other hook reads its config through `linearTrackerOptions(settings)`, never through raw
`settings.tracker.options` keys. `extensions/jira-tracker/src/options.ts` does the same with
`jiraTrackerOptions(settings)`. Unknown kinds parse leniently (the options pass through verbatim) and
only fail at `validateDispatchConfig`, which throws `unsupported tracker.kind: <k> (known kinds: ...)`.

## The agent-facing tools

A tracker backend gets the seven provider-neutral `tracker_*` tools for free by implementing
`createToolOps`. The neutral pack is named the literal string `"tracker"` and serves
`tracker_read_issue`, `tracker_query`, `tracker_update_status`, `tracker_list_comments`,
`tracker_comment`, `tracker_update_comment`, and `tracker_create_issue` against the `TrackerToolOps`
your provider returns.

`TrackerToolOps` (also in `provider.ts`) is all-optional:

```ts
interface TrackerToolOps {
  readIssue?(issueId: string): Promise<Issue>;
  queryIssues?(args: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<Issue[]>;
  queryRows?(args: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<TrackerQueryResult>;
  updateStatus?(issueId: string, status: string): Promise<Issue>;
  listComments?(issueId: string): Promise<TrackerComment[]>;
  addComment?(issueId: string, body: string): Promise<TrackerComment | void>;
  updateComment?(issueId: string, commentId: string, body: string): Promise<TrackerComment>;
  createIssue?(input: TrackerCreateIssueInput): Promise<Issue>;
}
```

A missing member makes that tool report itself unavailable with the message `tracker tools are
unavailable for <kind> tracker` rather than failing mid-call. For `tracker_query`, implement
`queryRows` if your backend projects natively (it takes precedence and its `{rows, total, skipped?}`
is returned verbatim); otherwise implement `queryIssues` and the pack projects rows in-memory through
the shared select/filter DSL with `DEFAULT_SELECT = [id, identifier, title, state, stateType, labels,
url]`. The memory tracker registers no tool ops, so the neutral pack advertises zero tools for it.

`defaultToolPacks` is a separate axis. It declares provider-specific packs (a separate `ToolProvider`
in `@lorenz/tool-sdk`) that mount by default when your tracker drives dispatch. Linear declares
`defaultToolPacks() => ["linear"]`, mounting the `linear` pack that exposes the `linear_graphql` tool;
Jira declares none and relies on the neutral pack alone. Tool packs are their own recipe; see
[tool-pack.md](tool-pack.md). The neutral `tracker_*` surface is detailed in
[reference/tracker-tools.md](../reference/tracker-tools.md).

## The recipe

Adding a tracker is a new package plus one registration call.

1. **Create the package.** Add `extensions/<name>-tracker/` with `package.json` named
   `@lorenz/<name>-tracker`. Depend on `@lorenz/domain` and `@lorenz/tracker-sdk` (and
   `@lorenz/tool-sdk` if you ship a tool pack), each as `workspace:*`. The dependency-cruiser rule
   `extensions-depend-on-sdk-layers-only` blocks any import of an engine package; your code may reach
   only `domain` and the SDKs.

2. **Implement and export the provider.** Write the `TrackerProvider` in `src/provider.ts`: set
   `kind`, implement `createClient`, and add the optional hooks you need. Keep provider config in
   `settings.tracker.options` behind a typed accessor in `src/options.ts`. Normalize backend payloads
   into the domain `Issue` shape in `src/client.ts`.

3. **Export an idempotent register function.** Add `src/register.ts` exporting
   `register<Name>Tracker(registries?)`. Default to the process-wide registries and skip a kind that
   is already present, so calling it twice is safe:

   ```ts
   export function registerNotionTracker(
     registries: { trackers?: TrackerRegistry; tools?: ToolRegistry } = {},
   ): void {
     const trackers = registries.trackers ?? defaultTrackerRegistry;
     if (trackers.get(notionTrackerProvider.kind) === undefined) {
       trackers.register(notionTrackerProvider);
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Wire it into the composition root.** `registerBuiltinBackends()` in `apps/cli/src/daemon.ts` is
   the single place backend identity is hardcoded. Import your register function and add one call
   inside it, alongside `registerLinearTracker`, `registerJiraTrackers`, `registerLocalTracker`,
   `registerMemoryTracker`, and `registerSlackTracker`. That is the one registration line.

5. **Install and reference the package.** Run `pnpm install` to link the new workspace package, then
   add a `references` entry pointing at `../../extensions/<name>-tracker` to `apps/cli/tsconfig.json`
   so the project build picks it up.

After this, `tracker.kind: <name>` in a workflow selects your backend. No core package is touched.
