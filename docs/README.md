# Lorenz docs

Lorenz is a control plane that turns tracker issues into coding-agent runs. It watches a tracker (Linear, Jira, a local board, Slack) for issues in active states, prepares an isolated workspace for each one, renders a prompt, and runs Codex or Claude over the Agent Client Protocol until the issue reaches a terminal state. Lorenz derives from [OpenAI's Symphony](https://github.com/openai/symphony), reimplemented in TypeScript. There is one control-plane process, no database, and a single authoritative in-memory snapshot every dashboard reads.

**Operators and users** running Lorenz against a tracker:

1. [Getting started](getting-started.md)
2. [How it works](how-it-works.md)
3. [Workflows](workflows.md)
4. [CLI](cli.md)
5. [Trackers](trackers/index.md)
6. [Observability](observability.md)
7. [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)

**Extension authors** adding a tracker, tool pack, executor, or worker driver:

1. [Architecture](architecture.md)
2. [Source map](source-map.md)
3. [Extensions](extensions/index.md)
4. [Tracker provider](extensions/tracker-provider.md)
5. [Tool pack](extensions/tool-pack.md)
6. [Agent executor](extensions/agent-executor.md)
7. [Worker driver](extensions/worker-driver.md)

**Integrators and spec readers** who need exact contracts:

1. [Reference](reference/index.md)
2. [Configuration](reference/configuration.md)
3. [Workflow and prompt](reference/workflow-prompt.md)
4. [CLI reference](reference/cli.md)
5. [HTTP API](reference/http-api.md)
6. [Events](reference/events.md)
7. [Tracker tools](reference/tracker-tools.md)
8. [Spec](reference/spec.md)
9. [Glossary](reference/glossary.md)

**Evaluators** deciding whether Lorenz fits:

1. [How it works](how-it-works.md)
2. [Architecture](architecture.md)
3. [Security](security.md)
4. [Roadmap](roadmap/index.md)
