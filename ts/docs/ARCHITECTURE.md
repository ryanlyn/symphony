# Architecture

This workspace is organized as a small provider-agnostic core plus self-contained extension
packages. The measure of cohesion we hold it to: adding a new backend (a tracker, a tool
pack, and over time an agent executor) is one new package that implements and registers its
own contracts, plus one line at the composition root invoking that registration - never a
sweep through domain, config, MCP, and CLI code.

## Layers

Dependencies point strictly downward. A package may import from its own layer or below,
never from above.

```

- **domain** holds pure types and leaf functions shared by everything. It carries no
  backend knowledge: `TrackerKind` is an open string and `TrackerSettings` contains only
  fields every tracker shares, plus an opaque `options` bag owned by the provider.
- **tracker-sdk** defines the `TrackerProvider` contract (dispatch client, config
  ownership, normalized `TrackerToolOps`), the `TrackerRegistry`, option parsing helpers,
  and the provider-neutral `tracker` pack (`createTrackerToolProvider`), which serves the
  `tracker_*` tools for whichever provider drives dispatch. **tool-sdk** defines the `ToolProvider` contract for agent-facing tool packs,
  the `ToolRegistry`, mount/routing helpers, `ToolSpec`/`ToolResult` shapes and result
  helpers, and the read-only query/filter DSL tool implementations reuse. **agent-sdk**
  defines the `AgentExecutorProvider` contract and `AgentExecutorRegistry` for runtime
  drivers behind `agents.<kind>.executor`.
- **extensions** implement those contracts. Each tracker package owns everything about its
  backend: its slice of the `tracker:` config section (aliases, validation, env fallbacks,
  defaults), the runtime client, its tool pack and `TrackerToolOps`, operator URLs, and
  its own registration (`registerLinearTracker(...)` etc.) - there is no central bundle.
- **engine** packages never import a provider or pack. They resolve `tracker.kind` through
  a `TrackerRegistry` and tool packs through a `ToolRegistry` (the process-wide defaults
  unless one is injected).
- **composition roots** decide what the binary supports. `apps/cli`'s
  `registerBuiltinBackends()` invokes each built-in extension's registration inside the
  entrypoints; a downstream embedder invokes a different set against its own registries.

## The tracker extension point

`TrackerProvider` (in `@symphony/tracker-sdk`) is the single contract between the core and
a tracker backend:

| Hook | Called by | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kind` | registry | `tracker.kind` selector |
| `configAliases` | config | snake_case aliases for provider keys |
| `envFallbacks` | config | env vars backing shared fields, keyed by field name |
| `defaultEndpoint` | config | endpoint when `tracker.endpoint` unset |
| `parseOptions` | config | validate/normalize provider keys into `settings.tracker.options` |
| `validateDispatch` | CLI startup | reject undispatchable settings early |
| `createClient` | runtime | the `RuntimeTrackerClient` that feeds dispatch |
| `createToolOps` | neutral tool pack | normalized issue operations behind `tracker_*` tools |
| `projectUrl` | TUI/dashboard | operator-facing project link |

Provider-specific settings never appear as named fields on `TrackerSettings`. They live in
`settings.tracker.options`, validated once at parse time by `parseOptions` and read through
the provider package's typed accessor (e.g. `linearTrackerOptions(settings)`,
`jiraTrackerOptions(settings)`). Core code must not read `options` keys directly.

Unknown `tracker.kind` values parse leniently (options pass through unvalidated) and are
rejected by `validateDispatchConfig` with the list of registered kinds. This keeps config
parsing usable in tests and tools that don't register providers, while the CLI still fails
fast at startup.

## The tool extension point

Agent-facing MCP tools are a separate axis from dispatch. `ToolProvider` (in
`@symphony/tool-sdk`) is a named pack of tools: `toolSpecs(settings)` advertises them and
`executeTool` runs one. Packs are registered in a `ToolRegistry` and mounted per workflow:

- The optional top-level `tools:` config list names the packs to mount (validated at
  startup against the registry; unknown names fail with the registered set).
- When `tools:` is omitted, the endpoint mounts the provider-neutral `tracker` pack plus
  the dispatch tracker's own pack when it ships one.
- Several packs can serve one endpoint while a single tracker drives dispatch - e.g.
  `tools: [tracker, linear, local]` exposes Linear and local-board tools on a Jira-dispatch
  workflow.

A mount is one flat tool namespace: name collisions across mounted packs fail loudly at
mount time. A pack that throws surfaces as a failed `ToolResult` (JSON-RPC `isError`),
never as a transport-level error.

The `tracker` pack (`createTrackerToolProvider` in `@symphony/tracker-sdk`) implements the
five provider-neutral `tracker_*` tools purely against `TrackerToolOps`, so any tracker whose provider implements
`createToolOps` gets read/query/status/comment/create tools without writing a pack.
Provider-specific packs (`linear`, `local`) live in their tracker packages and carry the
tools only that backend can offer.

### Adding a tracker backend

1. Create `extensions/<name>-tracker` depending on `@symphony/domain` and
   `@symphony/tracker-sdk` (plus `@symphony/issue` for `normalizeIssue`, and
   `@symphony/tool-sdk` if it ships a tool pack).
2. Implement a `RuntimeTrackerClient` and export a `TrackerProvider` that wires config
   parsing, validation, the client, and `createToolOps` for the neutral tools.
3. Export a `register<Name>Tracker(registries?)` function that registers the provider (and
   any pack) idempotently, and invoke it from `registerBuiltinBackends()` in `apps/cli`.
4. Add the package to the workspace plumbing (`pnpm install`, `pnpm tsconfig:refs --write`).

`test/tracker-extension.test.ts` is the executable form of this recipe: it defines a fake
provider entirely from SDK surface and drives config parsing, dispatch validation, client
creation, and MCP tools through it. If a new backend needs more than the steps above, that
test - and this document - have regressed.

The `extensions-depend-on-sdk-layers-only` dependency-cruiser rule holds the other side of
the bargain: a provider package that reaches into engine packages fails the build.

## The agent extension points

Agents extend along two independent axes:

- **Agent kinds** are pure configuration. `Settings.agents` is an open record; adding a
  backend like a custom bridge is a new `agents.<name>` entry in workflow YAML, no code.
  The legacy top-level `codex:` / `claude:` sections (and the `codex:` / `claude:` blocks
  inside `status_overrides`) are parse-time sugar that merges into the matching `agents`
  records - they do not exist on `Settings` at runtime, and per-state overrides use
  `PartialRuntimeSettings.agents`.
- **Executors** are how an agent record actually runs. `AgentExecutorProvider` (in
  `@symphony/agent-sdk`) is the contract: an `executor` selector (matched against
  `agents.<kind>.executor`), `validateAgent` for startup validation of records that select
  it, and `createExecutor` producing the `AgentExecutor` the agent-runner drives. The
  built-in `"acp"` executor lives in `@symphony/acp`; the CLI registers it at startup.
  `validateDispatchConfig` rejects records whose executor selector is unregistered, listing
  the known selectors.

The `AgentConfig` record shape is currently ACP-flavored (`bridgeCommand`,
`usageAccounting`, ...). Generalizing it into an executor-owned options bag - mirroring
`TrackerSettings.options` - is the designated next step if a second executor lands.

## The box driver extension point

The warm worker box pool (`@symphony/worker-box-pool`, an engine package) leases
SSH-addressable machines per run. The machines themselves come from a **box driver**:
the backend adapter that provisions, probes, destroys, and lists boxes for one
infrastructure (a cloud API, a container runtime, a fixed host list). "Driver" is
deliberate - "provider" is reserved for tracker/executor providers and reads as a
model/agent provider.

`BoxDriver` and `BoxDriverFactory` (in `@symphony/box-sdk`) are the contract:

| Hook | Called by | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kind` | registry | `worker.box_pool.driver` selector |
| `create(options, deps)` | pool construction / driver swap | build the driver from `driver_options`, validating them fail-loud |
| `provision` | pool grow / warm top-up | create (or re-adopt, idempotent on `boxId`) one box |
| `probe` | pool readiness gate, reaper health pass | cheap reachability check |
| `destroy` | reaper / recycle / drain | tear one box down (idempotent, tolerant of already-gone) |
| `list` | hydrate re-adoption, reaper reconcile | the backend's authoritative inventory |
| `capabilities` | pool | `sshAddressable` / `ephemeral` / `usesLedger` gates |

Drivers never see the pool's lifecycle state and never import engine packages: SSH
access arrives through `DriverDeps.runSsh` (injected by the pool, which owns the real
`@symphony/ssh` dependency), and `driver_options` arrive verbatim from
`worker.box_pool.driver_options`. The pool owns leasing, reaping, spend caps, the
write-ahead ledger, and crash recovery; every driver gets them for free.

The `fake` driver ships inside `@symphony/box-sdk` as the reference implementation and
the test double the engine suites lease against. The conformance kit
(`@symphony/box-sdk/conformance`, `runDriverConformanceSuite`) pins the contract every
driver must satisfy: provision idempotency, destroy tolerance, list-as-truth,
pool-owned label round-trip, and probe gating.

### Adding a box driver

1. Create `extensions/<name>-box-driver` depending on `@symphony/box-sdk` (plus
   `@symphony/domain` if it needs domain types).
2. Implement `BoxDriver` and export a `BoxDriverFactory` whose `create` validates
   `driver_options` and throws an actionable error when they are unusable.
3. Export a `register<Name>BoxDriver(registries?)` function that registers the factory
   idempotently, and invoke it from `registerBuiltinBackends()` in `apps/cli`. A driver
   needing an injected transport the binary does not ship (e.g. a cloud SDK client)
   registers a fail-loud factory by default and accepts the transport as a second
   argument for configured deployments.
4. Run `runDriverConformanceSuite` from `@symphony/box-sdk/conformance` in the
   extension's test suite.
5. Add the package to the workspace plumbing (`pnpm install`, `pnpm tsconfig:refs --write`).

## Composition and the default registries

`defaultTrackerRegistry`, `defaultToolRegistry`, and `defaultAgentExecutorRegistry` are
process-wide registries used as defaults by `parseConfig`, `validateDispatchConfig`, the
MCP server, and the CLI's executor factory. Library code only reads from them, and no
package registers into them as an import side effect: the CLI entrypoints call
`registerBuiltinBackends()` at the top of their function bodies, before any config is
parsed, so behavior never depends on module import order. Every entry point that needs
isolation (tests, embedders) constructs private registries and passes them explicitly -
all registry consumers accept them as parameters (`loadWorkflow` forwards a registry to
`parseConfig` via its `trackers` option).

## Enforcement

The layering is checked mechanically, not just documented. `.dependency-cruiser.cjs`
(run as `pnpm architecture:check`, part of `mise run check`) validates the real import
graph of every source file against the layer rules above, plus the file-level rules no
other gate covers: no circular imports, cross-package imports only through a package's
published surface (its `exports` map), and no package importing an app. An engine package
that imports a tracker provider fails CI. Extension membership is by directory: anything
under `extensions/` gets the extension rules by construction, and the engine (all of
`packages/`) may never import from it.

`pnpm architecture:graph` renders the same graph as Mermaid for inspection.

Two neighbouring gates close the remaining gaps: pnpm's strict `node_modules` plus
`scripts/sync-tsconfig-refs.ts` keep undeclared package.json dependencies unbuildable,
and knip flags dependencies that are declared but unused.

## Conventions that keep the boundary clean

- The engine never imports a tracker package or tool pack; `pnpm architecture:check`
  enforces it structurally.
- A provider package is self-contained: config knowledge, client, tool pack, and ops live
  together, and its tests live with it.
- Secrets resolution (`$VAR`, `op://`, env fallbacks) is core config machinery; providers
  only declare *which* env vars back their credentials.
- Tool failures are data (`ToolResult` with `isError`), never thrown across the MCP seam.
- The built-in set is declared in exactly one place: the composition root's
  `registerBuiltinBackends()`.
