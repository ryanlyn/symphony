 * point (`ToolProvider` in `@symphony/tool-sdk`): a tracker package may ship one, declare
 * it as a default pack for this tracker, and a workflow may still mount other registered
 * packs explicitly through its `tools:` map.
 *
 * The core (config parsing, runtime, MCP server, CLI) is provider-agnostic and talks to
 * providers exclusively through this contract via a {@link TrackerRegistry}. Adding a new
 * tracker backend means implementing this interface in a new package and registering it at
 * the composition root - no core package changes.
