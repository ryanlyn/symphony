//
// With the default settings (slotsPerMachine=1) and the NULL McpEndpointManager
// (perRunEndpoint=false, mcpEndpoint=null), every operation here is byte-identical
// at the runtime boundary to calling the underlying BoxPool directly:
//   - acquireRunSlot calls pool.acquire and, on `leased`, mints a RunSlot whose
//     release/fail/heartbeat delegate straight to the wrapped BoxLease (so the
//     pool's exactly-once leaseId/generation/DESTROYED guards and poison/healthy
//     classification are unchanged); a `no_capacity` result is returned with the
//     SAME typed reason; a THROWN pool fault PROPAGATES verbatim so the runtime's
//     catch emits box_pool_acquire_error.
//   - capacityProbe() is built ONCE (stable identity across reconcile) and
//     re-reads live pool state each call, so an orchestrator that captured the
//     probe in its ctor is never stranded by a reload.
//   - isEnabled/reconcile/drain/hydrate delegate verbatim; snapshot is the pool
//     snapshot extended with an empty `slots` array (the STEP 1 stub; live slot
//     accounting lands with per-run endpoints in later steps).
//
// The coordinator owns the authoritative per-slot registry so later steps can do
// per-issue fairness and recycle-driven fail-fast; in STEP 1 the registry only
// ever holds slots that were minted and not yet settled, and feeds the (empty in
// practice) snapshot.slots view.
