// Codex HIGH #1 regression: the FULL workflow Settings must be threaded end-to-end
// to the per-run endpoint open, NOT the coordinator's WorkerPoolSettings.
//
// This pins the integration the per-package unit suites cannot: the REAL
// `createPerRunEndpointManager` over a stub-at-the-ssh-child
// `acquireAgentMcpEndpointForRun` (structurally identical to the production one,
// reading `settings.server.port` exactly as the real `acquireRemoteMcpEndpoint`
// does), driven by the REAL `createDispatchCoordinator` over a fake machine pool.
// The ONLY thing stubbed is the leaf endpoint acquirer (so no token/local-server/
// ssh child is actually minted); the WHOLE settings-threading path the bug lived
// on is the real code.
//
// The bug: the coordinator forwarded its `WorkerPoolSettings` (cast to `Settings`) to
// `mcpEndpointManager.open`, so `settings.server.port` was undefined and the real
// `acquireAgentMcpEndpointForRun` threw `remote_acp_mcp_requires_server_port` ->
// every acquire skipped with worker_pool_acquire_error and the pool never dispatched.
// The fix threads the FULL workflow `Settings` (with `server.port`) through the
// `AcquireRunSlotRequest`. These tests assert the full Settings flows through and
// the endpoint opens, AND that the worker-pool-only settings WOULD have failed (so
// this test would have caught the original bug).
//
// Tests import the compiled package barrels (the suite runs against tsc --build).
