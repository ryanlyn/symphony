/**
 * The single-machine, in-process {@link WorkerDriver}. It provisions workers
 * whose `workerHost` is the EMPTY string, the canonical "no remote worker"
 * signal the orchestrator/endpoint-manager already understands: an empty host
 * mints NO tunnel and NO MCP lease, so acp keeps its own in-process MCP
 * endpoint and the run executes locally - byte-identical to the pre-pool local
 * dispatch path. A warm pool at `slotsPerMachine=1` over this driver therefore
 * reproduces today's local single-tenant execution exactly, which is what makes
 * a default-on pool safe.
 *
 * Mechanically it mirrors {@link FakeWorkerDriver}: a purely in-memory
 * `Map<workerId, WorkerDescriptor>`, deterministic `createdAtMs` from the
 * injected clock, idempotent provision/destroy, and a probe that returns
 * `{ ok: true }` WITHOUT touching SSH (there is no remote machine to reach).
 * The two differences from the fake driver are deliberate: the yielded
 * `workerHost` is empty (so downstream wiring takes the local-execution arm),
 * and the `driverRef` stays distinct per worker (`local://<workerId>`) so
 * destroy/list/reconcile key per-worker even though every worker shares the
 * empty host.
 *
 * This driver is single-machine by design: the pool affinity-keys on
 * `workerHost`, so an empty host collapses every local worker into ONE affinity
 * bucket. That is inert at the only configuration this driver is meant for
 * (`slotsPerMachine=1`, `max=1`): there is at most one local worker, so the
 * bucket never matters.
